    <h1>Welcome to the Xplore App</h1>

    <p>
        This is a lil dummy app to learn Svelte with. It's a basic ToDo app with some fun. 
        Spooderman will give you random ToDos in your list 
        <b>and will hold you accountable to them</b>. Just give him a click and he'll tell you what to do.
        If you haven't got ToDos, click the button on the form screen and we'll generate some for you.
